## Responsible Use Statement

This tool explores how AI can support analysts and policy teams.  
It is an **educational prototype**, not a government service.

### **Principles of Responsible Use**
1. **Verify before use** – Confirm key figures with the original publication before citing them.  
2. **Apply professional judgement** – AI generated insights assist analysis but never replace expert review.  
3. **Be transparent about sources** – Always attribute official data providers clearly.  
4. **Respect limitations** – Recognise differences in scope and methodology between datasets.  
5. **Protect the integrity of statistics** – Avoid mixing experimental or unofficial data with certified series.  
6. **Promote data literacy** – Use this tool to strengthen understanding, not to automate decisions.  
7. **Ensure accountability** – Users are responsible for how outputs are interpreted and applied.
